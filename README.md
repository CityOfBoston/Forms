# Forms
A list of/way to track progress of City of Boston digital forms managed by the [City of Boston Digital Team](https://boston.gov), along with some related data and project notes. Note: This is not an exhaustive list of all of the 'forms' managed by the City of Boston.

We're working to provide a digital form alongside all paper forms and pdfs in the City of Boston. If you want to come to City Hall to do business with us, we'll be here for you. But, if your only option is to come to a City office to do business with us, then we can do better.  

# How we use this repo

Visit the [issues](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/Forms/issues) section. Each issue represents a paper, pdf, or web form. Comments and labels provide more information about that form and indicate it's status in the process. Closed issues represent forms successfully moved online. 

If you have any questions, please contact digital@boston.gov.
