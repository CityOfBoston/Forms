# Forms
A list of City of Boston Forms, along with some related data and project notes.

We're working to eliminate all paper forms and pdfs in the City of Boston. This is where we are storing a database of files, owners, and status documents. There's no real code, but since we integrate so closely with the web team, it helps to keep it in the same place. 

If you have any questions, please contact joshua.gee@boston.gov.
