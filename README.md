# Forms
A list of City of Boston Forms managed by the [City of Boston Digital Team](https://boston.gov), along with some related data and project notes. Note: This is not an exhaustive list of all of the 'forms' managed by the City of Boston.

We're working to eliminate all paper forms and pdfs in the City of Boston. If you want to come to City Hall to do business with us, we'll be here for you. But if you *have* to come to City Hall to do business with us, then we're not doing our job. This is where we are storing a database of files, owners, and status documents. There's no real code, but since we integrate so closely with the web team, it helps to keep it in the same place. 

# How we use this repo

Visit the issues sections. Each issue represents a paper, pdf, or web form. Comments and labels provide more information about that form and indicate it's status in the process. Closed issues represent forms successfully moved online. 

If you have any questions, please contact digital@boston.gov.
