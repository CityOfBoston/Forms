# Forms
A list of/way to track progress of City of Boston digital forms managed by the [City of Boston Digital Team](https://boston.gov), along with some related data and project notes. Note: This is not an exhaustive list of all of the 'forms' managed by the City of Boston.

We're working to provide a digital form alongside all paper forms and pdfs in the City of Boston. If you want to come to City Hall to do business with us, we'll be here for you. But, if your only option is to come to a City office to do business with us, then we can do better.  

# How we use this repo
Visit the [issues](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/Forms/issues) section. Each issue represents a paper, pdf, or web form. Comments and labels provide more information about individual forms. We track our progress in [this Github project](https://github.com/orgs/CityOfBoston/projects/5) Closed issues represent forms successfully moved online. You can read more about the [overall project here](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/digital/wiki/Forms-Online).

If you have any questions, please contact digital@boston.gov.

# How to style forms
Forms should be styled using the [City of Boston brand](https://boston.gov/brand). A [stylesheet](https://github.com/CityOfBoston/cob-themes/tree/master/seamless_docs) is set up for forms. Forms can also be embedded into Drupal.
