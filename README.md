# Forms
A list of City of Boston Forms, along with some related data and project notes.

We're working to eliminate all paper forms and pdfs in the City of Boston. This is where we are storing a database of files, owners, and status documents. There's no real code, but since we integrate so closely with the web team, it helps to keep it in the same place. 

If you have any questions, please contact joshua.gee@boston.gov.

# Project History

Last year we went through an WQC process for a web form tool. We solicited three bids and procured SeamlessDocs as part of a pilot program. Our goal in the pilot was to move fast and learn. We weren’t trying to fix every department’s process but to focus on the customer experience and eliminating paper forms and pdfs. We've uploaded a copy of our WQC.

Over the course of the pilot, we identified over 400 forms across the city. Some of these were paper, some were pdfs, and some were existing web forms on old technology. A large number of these forms are also being converted via larger enterprise projects. We're finding new forms every day. 

# Things we learned

* There is huge demand to move forms online in the departments;
* we initially thought there would be a strong demand for submissions that look exactly like current forms. That hasn't been the case an. 
* departments almost immediately asked for tools to help them move to all-digital processes; 
* we've avoided getting into workflow changes, but as we find a need for a workflow tool that will become more important; 
* functionality around conditional fields, logic, and branching are really important;

# Key learning

A huge number of forms are interrelated or dependant on back end processes that aren't always uniform or consistent. Process change and good workflow software is as important or more important than form software.
